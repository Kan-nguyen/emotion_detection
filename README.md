# Emotion_Detection
Emotion detection is an interesting blend of psychology and technology. Though arguably reductive, many facial expression detection tools lump human emotion into 7 main categories: Happy, Surprise ,Sad, Anger, Neutral, Fear, Disgusted. With facial emotion detection, algorithms detect faces within a  video, and sense micro expressions by analyzing the relationship between points on the face, based on eye, nose, mouth.
